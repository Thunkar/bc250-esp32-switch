//   GPIO5  (BUTTON_SENSE)  <-----> momentary switch terminal A
//   GPIO6  (BUTTON_GND)    <-----> momentary switch terminal B
//   GPIO4  (PS_ON_PIN)     <-----> ATX PS_ON# (green wire, active LOW)
//   GPIO3  (BOARD_SENSE)   <-----> BC250 TPMS1 pin 9 (3.3V = board on)
//
// The switch bridges GPIO5 and GPIO6. GPIO6 is driven LOW to act as a local
// ground, and GPIO5 is read with an internal pull-up: pressed reads LOW.
const int BUTTON_SENSE = 5;
const int BUTTON_GND   = 6;

// ATX PS_ON# is active LOW and idles at ~5V (pulled up inside the PSU).
// Driven as OPEN-DRAIN so we never push 3.3V against the PSU's 5V pull-up:
//   LOW  -> sink to GND -> PSU on
//   HIGH -> high-impedance -> PSU pull-up wins -> PSU off
const int PS_ON_PIN = 4;

// BC250 TPMS1 (pin 9): reads ~3.3V while the board is powered/booted, 0 when
// off. In practice it's a higher-impedance source that settles near ~2.9V and
// hovers close to the ESP's digital logic threshold, so digitalRead() flickers.
// We read it as an ADC voltage with hysteresis instead (see thresholds below).
const int BOARD_SENSE = 3;

// Hysteresis thresholds for the analog board-sense reading. The gap between
// them keeps a noisy signal sitting near the threshold from chattering:
//   reading rises above HIGH -> treat as "board up"
//   reading falls below LOW  -> treat as "board down"
//   in between               -> hold previous state

// design flaw (arduino-esp32 #6551): at full power the AP emits no usable
// beacons, so the portal is invisible. A low value fixes it. WIFI_POWER_8_5dBm
// is confirmed working on this board.

//*******  BLE wake  ***************

// The bound controller's BLE MAC is configured via the setup portal and stored
// in NVS (see config.h: config.wakeAddr). When the machine is OFF and that
// controller is advertising, we power on ("machine follows controller").

// The controller counts as "present" while it has been seen within this window.
// While OFF, presence => the machine powers on ("machine follows controller").
const unsigned long BLE_PRESENCE_TIMEOUT_MS = 4000;

// Guard window after any power-off during which BLE presence is ignored. This is
// your chance to also switch the controller off (it then goes absent and the
// machine stays down). If you leave the controller on, once this elapses the
// machine follows it back on. It also rides out the brief reconnect-advertising
// burst the controller emits when it loses its host at shutdown.
